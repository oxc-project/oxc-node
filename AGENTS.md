# Oxnode

oxc-node is a fast Node.js dev tool providing TypeScript/JavaScript transformation and module resolution based on [Oxc](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc). It consists of a Rust native module (NAPI-RS) that transforms TypeScript/JavaScript files on-the-fly via Node.js import hooks.

# Architecture

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
CLI (packages/cli)
       ↓
NAPI Bindings (packages/core)
       ↓
Rust Core (src)
```

## Auto-generated Files

MANDATORY: NEVER edit these files directly.

- `packages/core/index.d.ts` - Based on `src`, auto-generated by `just build-core`
- `packages/core/index.js` - Based on `src`, auto-generated by `just build-core`

# Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

- **Check surrounding code for conventions:** Before adding new code, always study the existing patterns, naming conventions, and architectural choices in the file and directory you are working in.
- **Break large changes into tracked steps:** Decompose substantial work into manageable subtasks. Track progress to prevent scope creep and missed items. Use `TodoWrite` or similar tools to maintain a checklist.
- **Batch multiple edits:** Prefer to batch multiple edits over sequential single edits. Use `MultiEdit` or similar tools if available.
